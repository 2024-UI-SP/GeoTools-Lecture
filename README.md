# GeoTool-Lecture
This repository contains three projects for demonstrating running GeoTools modules in Gradle and in a Grails app:

- `gradle-geotools` - demonstrates building a GeoTools app using Gradle.
- `grails-bean` - demonstrates injecting, instantiating beans in a Grails app.
- `grails-geotools` - demonstrates using GeoTools in beans, services and controllers in a Grails app.

To run `gradle-geotools`, open a bash terminal, change to the gradle-geotools directory, then enter:
```
./gradlew run
```

To run either `grails-bean` or `grails-geotools`, open a bash terminal, change to the directory, then enter:
```
./gradlew bootRun
```
